# DeveloperStore

** How to Run the Project **

Use the appsettings.json file as a reference.
Modify the database settings according to your preference (supports SQL Server, MySQL, and PostgreSQL).
Store the database configurations in the application Secrets (DeveloperStore.UI).

** Database Configuration **

The application uses Entity Framework Migrations, so if the Secrets are configured correctly, the database will be created automatically when the application runs.

# DeveloperStore

** How to Run the Project **

1. Use the appsettings.json file as a reference.
2. Modify the database settings according to your preference (supports SQL Server, MySQL, and PostgreSQL).
2. Store the database configurations in the application Secrets (DeveloperStore.UI).

** Database Configuration **

1. The application uses Entity Framework Migrations, so if the Secrets are configured correctly, the database will be created automatically when the application runs.
